# Titanic-and-FC-Prediction
Titanic Problem and Forest Cover Prediction : Kaggle Competition

Repository contains two problems
1. Classical Titanic Problem : Strating Point of ML
2. Forest Cover Prediction : Part Of Kaggle Competitiom

You can find dataset for training, as test dataset was huge. I chose not to ad them here.

To run files you need anaconda jupyter notebook.

Problems had both categorical and continuous features. 
Before running the algorithm, little features engineering is done.


For both problems, RandomForest classifier is used. Scikit-Learn module.
